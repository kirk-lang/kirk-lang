Kirk is an experimental programming language and compiler written in C++. The goal is simple: fast compilation with helpful, human-friendly error messages. Instead of plain errors, Kirk explains what went wrong and suggests fixes.

- The project is in early development.
- Current focus is the frontend: lexer, parser, and diagnostics.
- LLVM is used for code generation.

## Features (Implemented)

* **Type System:** Built-in types `int`, `float`/`double`, and `bool` with automatic type casting between them.
* **Typed Variable Declarations:** Variables can be declared with explicit types (`int x = 5`, `double pi = 3.14`, `bool flag = true`).
* **Variables:** Support for variable assignment and lookups.
* **Boolean Literals:** Support for `true` and `false` boolean values.
* **Math:** Full support for arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`) with operator precedence, including exponentiation.
* **Unary Operators:** Support for unary negation (`-x`).
* **Comparison Operators:** Full set of comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `>=`).
* **Control Flow:** `if`/`else` expressions and `while` loops with block syntax (`{ ... }`).
* **Block Expressions:** Group multiple expressions using `{ ... }` syntax.
* **Comments:** Single-line comments using `//` syntax.
* **Print:** Built-in `print()` function for output (supports int, double, and bool types).
* **Memory Management:** Automatic stack allocation using LLVM `alloca`, `store`, and `load`.
* **LLVM Backend:** Compiles source code directly to optimized LLVM IR (`output.ll`).
* **Smart Compiler (Phase 1):** Support for smart compiler error enhancements, where it suggests you what changes to make (using Levenshtein distance for variable name suggestions).

## Build and Run

Requires LLVM and a C++ compiler.

### Quick Start

Use the included helper script to compile the compiler, generate the IR, link it, and run the executable in one go:

```bash
chmod +x update_compiler.sh
./update_compiler.sh
chmod +x compile_and_run.sh
./compile_and_run.sh test.kirk
```

### Manual Build

If you want to build the compiler binary manually:

```bash
clang++ main.cpp Lexer.cpp Parser.cpp Codegen.cpp Algorithms.cpp `llvm-config --cxxflags --ldflags --system-libs --libs core` -o kirk
```

Rest steps will be the same from the Quick Start section.

## Example Code 

```kirk
// Typed variable declarations
int width = 10
int height = 5
double pi = 3.14

// Variables are mutable and memory-managed
int area = width * height
width = 20
int new_area = width * height

// Complex expressions with precedence
int result = (width + height) * 2

// Exponentiation
int x = 3
double squared = x ^ 2

// Boolean values
bool flag = true
bool check = x > height

// Control flow with if/else
int max = if x > height then x else height

// While loops
int counter = 0
while counter < 5 {
  print(counter)
  counter = counter + 1
}

// Print output (supports int, double, and bool)
print(result)
print(pi)
print(flag)
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic Arithmetic
- [x] Variables & Memory Assignment
- [x] Type System (int, float/double, bool)
- [x] Typed Variable Declarations
- [x] Better Error Diagnostics
- [x] Control Flow (if / else)
- [x] Comparison Operators (<, >, ==, !=, <=, >=)
- [x] While Loops
- [x] Print Function
- [x] Comments (single-line)
- [ ] Functions

## Status

**Active Development.**

The compiler supports typed variables (`int`, `double`, `bool`), arithmetic (including exponentiation), control flow (`if`/`else`, `while`), comparison operators, boolean literals, single-line comments, and output via `print()`.

> After a certain phase of development, both the 'Build' and 'Run' phase will be packaged in a separate "Kirk Compiler" package.
